# Simple-Dnd-Task-Manager

This a simple task/project managing application created with the React library and relies on other external dependencies such as Atlassian's react-beautiful-dnd. With this application, users can create, delete and rearrange tasks and cards (which houses one or many tasks).

## Motivation

I created this little project for myself to build upon my knowledge of React to create something a little more complex. It is purely made for educational purposes; helping me to consolidate my knowledge of React concepts, understand its component-based architecture and understand how to use third-party React dependencies.
